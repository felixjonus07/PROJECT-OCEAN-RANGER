# 🌊 Ocean Ranger

## 📌 Project Overview
**Ocean Ranger** is an internal signal-based navigation system designed to assist ocean fishermen in identifying country borders and navigating safely without radar or satellite connections. The system uses onboard transmitters and receivers to calculate the boat's position based on frequency shifts, speed, and heading changes.

## 🚀 Features
- Autonomous navigation system for fishermen
- Maritime border detection and alerts
- Cost-effective and wireless navigation
- Real-time position tracking using Doppler effect
- User-friendly interface
- Independent of radar or internet connectivity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** C (for implementation on Arduino board)
- **Embedded Systems:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- **Mathematical Models:** Doppler Effect, Dead Reckoning
- **Data Processing:** Real-time position tracking

## 🎯 Usage
- Implement Dead Reckoning and Doppler Effect calculations for navigation.
- Utilize transmitters and receivers for real-time tracking.
- Monitor alerts for border proximity and navigation guidance.

## 🏗️ Key Components
- **Transmitters:** Emit signals at a known frequency from two sides of the boat.
- **Receiver:** Measures frequency shifts and calculates heading changes.
- **Data Processing:** Uses Doppler effect to determine speed and position.
- **Dead Reckoning:** Predicts position updates based on previous known location.
- **Display & Alerts:** Provides real-time position tracking and border alerts.

## 🏆 Advantages Over Existing Systems
- Lower cost than AIS systems
- Does not require external wireless networks
- Designed specifically for local fishermen
- Provides real-time, reliable navigation assistance

## 📌 Applicable Domains
- **Fisheries**: Safe border navigation for fishermen.
- **Military & Navy**: Secure maritime operations.
- **Forestry & Remote Navigation**: Position tracking in dense terrains.
